# Metrics

Metrics define values and ranges of values, which are the main content of this project.

Each Metric is a folder containing:

- a descriptive file (YAML): index.yaml
- a readme (Markdown): readme.md
- optionally additional files like images used by the readme

## File Format 

info.yaml:

|Property|Value|Description|
|-------|--------|-------|
| type |  metric              |  file type  |
| title |  Kardashev Rating   |   title/name to appear on a future web site |
| tags |  [fav, new]             |  tags control how this metric is listed/highlighted, etc.  |
| dataType |  number          |   most values will be numbers, but there might be other value sets |
| unit |  Kardashev           |  the unit of measure (in this case: one Kardashev level  |
| range |  0-3                |  number range  |
