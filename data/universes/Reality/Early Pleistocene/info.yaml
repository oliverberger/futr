        At a 3000 kcal per day diet. 
        That makes 130 W.
        Plus 70 W for open fires, cooking, etc. to make a round 200 W figure.
        Disregarding sunlight as always. 

        At how much power does a camp fire run? Also camp fire may have a 1% efficiency. 
        Do we count the useful warmth as "energy use" or do we include 99% waste heat?

        If the population were in the millions instead of in the 10.000s then we are easily at K 0.4 just by warm bodies.
