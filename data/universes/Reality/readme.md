# Real Life

From [tvtropes: Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SlidingScale/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness):

A [Shared Universe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse) which spawned its own genre, known as "Non-Fiction". 
Despite the various problems noted at [Reality Is Unrealistic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic), it is almost universally agreed that there is no other universe known so thoroughly worked out from established scientific principles. 
The [Apollo Program](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASA), [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII), and [Woodstock](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Woodstock) play out in this franchise.
