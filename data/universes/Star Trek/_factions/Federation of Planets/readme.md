# Federation of Planets
The Federation of Planets is a union of various species in the Milky Way Galaxy.

## Membership
The Federation was founded in 2161 by the United Earth, the Vulcan High Command, the Andorian Empire, and the Tellarite Confederacy.
Member worlds work together in mutual cooperation, sharing resources, knowledge, and maintaining peace within their territories.

## Starfleet
Starfleet is the exploratory and defensive arm of the Federation.

## Politics and Governance
The Federation is a representative republic with its capital located on Earth, in the city of San Francisco.
The President of the United Federation of Planets is the head of state and government.
The Federation Council, consisting of representatives from each member world, is the primary legislative body.

## Prime Directive
One of the core principles of the Federation is the Prime Directive, also known as Starfleet General Order 1.
It prohibits Starfleet personnel and Federation citizens from interfering with the internal development of alien civilizations, especially pre-warp societies.
This non-interference policy is a reflection of the Federation's respect for the sovereignty and natural evolution of other cultures.

## Diplomacy and Exploration
The Federation is engaged in various diplomatic endeavors, maintaining peace treaties, and exploring uncharted regions of space.
While they have allies like the Vulcans and Andorians, they also face challenges from adversaries such as the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Star Empire.

## Technological Advancements
The Federation is at the forefront of technological innovation. It is a post-scarcity society, meaning that all basic needs are met for all citizens. 
Federation starships are equipped with warp drive, allowing faster-than-light travel, and transporters, which can dematerialize and rematerialize objects and people over short distances.
The development and use of advanced technologies for medicine, communication, and defense are also prevalent.

## Cultural Exchange
One of the Federation's strengths is its diversity.
With so many member worlds, there's a rich tapestry of cultures, philosophies, and ideas.
This diversity is celebrated and leads to a vibrant exchange of knowledge and understanding among its members.
