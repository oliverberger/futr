# Vulcans
The Vulcans are a humanoid species from the plant Vulcan. 
They are known for their logical and stoic nature.
- Physical Appearance: Vulcans are similar in appearance to humans but have pointed ears. 
Their blood is based on copper, which gives it a green color.
- Culture and Philosophy: Vulcans live by the principle of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), which celebrates the vast array of variables in the universe. 
They have a rich history and a commitment to peace, diplomacy, and exploration. Their society is built on the pursuit of knowledge.
- Emotion and Logic: While Vulcans have emotions, they are trained from a young age to suppress them in favor of logic. 
This is a result of their violent past, from which they evolved by embracing a philosophy of total logic.
- Mind Meld: One of the unique abilities of Vulcans is the mind meld, where they can merge their mind with another being, sharing thoughts, memories, and experiences.
