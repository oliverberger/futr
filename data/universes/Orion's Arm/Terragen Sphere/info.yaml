          Counting only Modosophonts, not Transsapients 
          - because higher toposophics do not make much of a dent compared to the S<1 population
          - using the Banks-Scheme which counts higher intelligence logarithmically, 
          - because transsapient populations scale down by a factor of about 1000 per level
          - while the logarithm of the intelligence/awareness/saphens) growth per level is between 4 and 8, 
          - using a per level intelligence factor between 10 k and 100 mio., 
          - considering that 15 k is given for the first level 
          - and applying that to all other levels
          - which is for sure wrong, but better than nothing for an estimate that uses a log scale anyway.
