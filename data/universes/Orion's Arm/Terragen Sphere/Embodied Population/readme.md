Counting only Modosophonts, not Transsapients 
- because higher toposophics do not make much of a dent compared to the S<1 population
- because transsapient populations scale down by a factor of about 1000 per level
- while the logarithm of the intelligence/awareness/saphens growth per level is between 4 and 8, 
- using the Banks-Scheme which counts higher intelligence logarithmically, 
- using a per level intelligence factor between 10 k and 100 mio., 
- considering that 15 k is given for the first toposophic level 
- and applying that to all other levels
- which is probably wrong, but better than nothing for an estimate that uses a log scale anyway.
